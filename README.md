SCSS Prompt

Create a page with 3 rows, with the following column layout, all column blocks have equal widths to fill the row. Add background colors to each block that corresponds to their block text and then structure the dom in a way where we can see the following layout:
[red][orange]
[blue]
[black][green][green]

At a breakpoint of 600px and below, the blocks should stack in this order:
[red]
[orange]
[blue]
[green]
[yellow]
[black]

Structure the DOM however you wish to achieve the desired results using SCSS.
